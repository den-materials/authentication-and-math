<!--Hook: Raise your hand if you fully understood our authentication class a week ago.  Raise your hand if you realized that was a week ago.  Today, we're going to try a more fun approach to this, to try and put things in more real terms. -->

### Objectives:

* **Understand** the basic math concepts behind modular arithmetic
* **Apply** this concept to server authentication
* **Warm up** your brains, have fun (with MATH!)

### Warm-up:  The Russian Postal Problem
Today we're going to enact a metaphor for auth inspired by [The Russian Postal Problem](http://www.jwstelly.org/BrainTeaser/Problem.php?id=14)

Form groups and try to solve the problem. (If you've seen this one already, you can give hints, but please don't give it away.)

<summary>Solution:</summary>

* Boris puts the jewel in the box with one lock and sends it to Natasha.
* Natasha puts her own lock on the box and returns it to Boris (with both locks).
* Boris removes his lock with his own key and sends it back with just Natasha's lock.
* Natasha can unlock the box with her key.

### An Introduction to Modular Arithmetic

![](remainders.gif)

Remember remainders from division?  That's what modular arithmetic is all about.  In mathematics, modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a certain value, also knows as the **modulus**.

Let's see what that looks like on the white board...

<!--Main points: Start by dividing a big number like 1230 by 10, then 1233...where does the remainder go?  Now let's try a number like 7.  What about binary?  What happens when we multiply two semi-big numbers by each other?  18*30 mod 17, for instance....  Notice that we can just take the remainders off the top and multiply them together.  That's because the rest is all 0 mod 17...and 0*anything = 0. -->

_Note: This is an excellent video, with two gotchas. First, the narrator says "forty-two" when the display shows "46" several times. (46 is correct.) Second, there is a moment when `16^54 mod 17` is converted to `3^(24*54) mod 17` without explanation. This can be simplified and proven more easily using 3^6 and 3^8.  Let's do that now..._

Suppose Alice chose `6` as her random number. She would perform the equation: 
<code>3^6 mod 17 &equiv; 15</code> and send 15 to Bob.
Suppose too that Bob chose `8` as his random number. He would perform the equation:
<code>3^8 mod 17 &equiv; 16</code>, and send 16 to Alice.

Now Alice can start with Bob's public key (16) and raise to the exponent of her secret key:
<code>16^6 mod 17 &equiv; 1</code>
Bob does the same by raising Alice's public key by *his* secret:
<code>15^8 mod 17 &equiv; 1</code>

Now they both know the password, but Eve cannot determine it, because she does not know Alice's `6` or Bob's `8`

The simplified math can be hacked in a reasonable amount of time, but if the secret key was (for example) a 40-digit hexidecimal value, it would take a long, long time.

<!--Really helps to put up a chart with Alice, Eve, and Bob, and what numbers they can all see -->

#### Pairing Activity: Test the math
<!--We should model this out with one student and an instructor picking a number each, everything transparent-->

* Developers begin with the simplified algorithm `3^n mod 7` as the "shared secret"
* Each developer selects a random number `n`  -- this is your "secret key" -- don't share it.
* Perform the calculation `3^n mod 7` and share only the remainder. This is your "public key"
* Take your partner's public key and raise it to your secret key.
* Did you get the same, new remainder?

<!--If time, do it again with new numbers -->

#### `3^n mod 17` vs `3^n mod 7` Reference Table

17 and 7 are prime numbers. One of these will be our prime modulus.
The primitive root of a number is one that has no factors in common where, if you raise the root by any exponent, the modulus will return a different value, until the sequence repeats itself.

Modular math can also be illustrated with a clock:

![](mod17.png)

For positive numbers, move clockwise. (For negative numbers, move counter-clockwise.) Now we can see how <code>3^3 mod 17 &equiv; 10</code>
